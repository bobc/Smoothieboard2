Turn off power before changing connections.

Connect power supply to JP2. Voltage should be in range 12-24V, max current 7A.

Connect load (fan, heater) to JP3. For polarized loads, pin 2 is positive (marked on PCB) 

Connect JP1 to Smoothieboard "output" connector. The logic signal should be 3.3-5V to turn on the MOSFET.  The LED will
be on when the output is on.

Note: the output is not isolated, ground is shared with Smoothieboard.
